        <p>2014 has been a thrilling year for our family. Between traveling, hosting travelers, and welcoming a new baby into the family, there has been nary a dull moment (we actually wouldn't mind a couple of dull moments now and then to be honest)!</p>
        <p>Daniel is on the final stretch of his Ph.D. progam. If everything goes according to plan, he'll defend his dissertation (back in Ames) in April and then start a postdoctoral fellowship some time in the summer. Daniel's applying for several postdoc positions all over the country, so it will be nice in a couple of months to know what the next few years will hold for our family!</p>
        <p>Stephanie is very happy to be home with the family after 3 tedious weeks in the hospital with our premature baby. The nursing staff in the special care nursery grew very fond of Stephanie (they even put her to work a couple of times!) and were sad to see her leave. Now, instead of waking up every 3 hours to walk to the nursery and feed the baby, she can wake up every 3 hours and feed him in the comfort of our bedroom!</p>
        <p>Heather is "almost 6" and started kindergarten this year. She's in a mixed K-2 class and really likes her teacher Mr. Somers-Glenn. Her favorite things are recess, PE, reading books, and making crafts.</p>
        <p>Joshua is 3 going on 4 and is a budding scientist. He has a voracious appetite for books and movies about volcanoes, earthquakes, geology, and the solar system (ask him which dwarf planet is his favorite)! He also likes "gymnastics" and burns energy doing somersaults, head stands, and his own signature moves.</p>
        <p>Joseph Henry was born 7 weeks early on October 21st. He weighed in at a whopping 3lbs 4oz and was 16in long. With him being so early, the doctors were very concerned about his health, but he exceeded their expectations time and again. He had no infections, required no respiratory assistance, and (with Stephanie's constant care) steadily put on enough weight that he was able to come home after 3 weeks. His favorite activities at home include eating, sleeping, pooping, and being held by mom ALL. THE. TIME.</p>
        <p>We have so much to be thankful for, especially all of the friends and family whose relationships bring us so much happiness! We wish you a wonderful Christmas, a happy New Year, and all that the true spirit of the season has to offer!</p>
        <p><br />With love,<br />Daniel, Stephanie, Heather, Joshua, and Joseph</p>
        <p><br />P.S. We hope you enjoy these photos from the past year!</p>
